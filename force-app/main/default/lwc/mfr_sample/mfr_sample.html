                                                BRIDION is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to sugammadex or any of its components. Hypersensitivity reactions that occurred varied from isolated skin reactions to serious systemic reactions (i.e., anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock) and have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to sugammadex.
Potentially serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred in patients treated with BRIDION. In a clinical study, anaphylaxis occurred in 0.3% (n=1/299) of healthy volunteers treated with BRIDION. The most common hypersensitivity adverse reactions reported were nausea, pruritus and urticaria and showed a dose response relationship, occurring more frequently in the 16 mg/kg group compared to the 4 mg/kg and placebo groups. Observe patients for an appropriate period of time after administration and take the necessary precautions. Anaphylaxis has also been reported in the post-marketing setting. Clinical features in anaphylaxis reports have included dermatologic symptoms; hypotension often requiring the use of vasopressors; and prolonged hospitalization and/or the use of additional respiratory support until full recovery.
Cases of marked bradycardia, some of which have resulted in cardiac arrest, have been observed within minutes after the administration of BRIDION. Monitor for hemodynamic changes and treat with anticholinergic agents, such as atropine, if clinically significant bradycardia is observed.
Ventilatory support is mandatory for patients until adequate spontaneous respiration is restored and the ability to maintain a patent airway is assured. Should neuromuscular blockade persist after BRIDION or recur following extubation, take appropriate steps to provide adequate ventilation.
In clinical trials, a small number of patients experienced a delayed or minimal response to BRIDION. Monitor ventilation until recovery occurs.
A minimum waiting time is necessary before re-administration of a steroidal neuromuscular blocking agent after administration of BRIDION.
