                    <p class="modal-para">This website of Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, N.J., USA (the “company”)
                        includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the
                        U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon the
                        current beliefs and expectations of the company’s management and are subject to significant
                        risks and uncertainties. There can be no guarantees with respect to pipeline products that the
                        products will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that they will prove to be
                        commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties
                        materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking
                        statements.<br /><br />
                        Risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to, general industry conditions and
                        competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate
                        fluctuations; the impact of the global outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19); the
                        impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation in the United States
                        and internationally; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances,
                        new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product
                        development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the company’s ability to accurately
                        predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of
                        international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the company’s
                        patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including
                        patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions.<br /><br />
                        The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether
                        as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Additional factors that could cause
                        results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found
                        in the company’s 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K and the company’s other filings with the
